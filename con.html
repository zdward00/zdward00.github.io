      <p>If I were to attend a Con as an anime/Pokemon character, I'd hope everyone would be okay with me doing something anime adjacent, a comic book hero.
        I'd dress up as Miles Morales from the Marvel Universe as he's my favorite superhero, and we bare a bit of resemblance in looks and personality. For those
        unfamiliar, Miles takes on the mantle of Spider-Man in the Ultimate Universe after the death of the Ultimate Universe's Peter Parker. Miles is a Black and Latino
        teenager living in Brooklyn who, like Peter, is a brilliant, good-natured kid that happened to get bit a radioactive spider. The spider that bit Miles 
        was a different spider however, resulting in slightly different powers. While Miles did acquire the same powers as Peter, enhanced agility, spider-proportionate 
        strength, spider-sense, the ability to cling to surfaces, etc., he also gained two additional powers. His most notable power is his bioelectricity, which initially 
        was a sharp shock to whatever Miles was in contact with. Over time, Miles began to develop his bioelectricity to be able to emit electricity from his body, store 
        electricity, and even manifest electricity into a weapon. Additionally, Miles also gained the ability to turn invisible, which has proved to be a beneficial utility
        many times over. 

        Below are pictures of my custom Miles Morales Comme Des Garcons Converse and Nike Spider-Verse Hoodie. Both were inspired by Miles' first custom costume in 
        'Into the Spider-Verse', one of my all-time favorite movies. The suit featured Miles in a spraypainted Spider-Man costume covered with a windbreaker style jacket
        and the Air Jordan 1 High 'Chicago'. While I do like Jordan's as a shoe, I don't think they fit my style personally, so I opted to use the Jordan's as 
        inspiration for shoes that I actually wear. I painted a mask over the heart that's native to the shoe then drew some webbing.

        For the hoodie, I simply reached out to a local sewer who has mastered a style of stitching called chain-stitching. Since the front of the hoodie already has the Nike
        logo on it, I didn't want to try to cover that up and end up with a bulky chest area. For that reason, I decided to just add the logo to the back. In true Miles fashion,
        you could say I opted to "do my own thing".</p>
