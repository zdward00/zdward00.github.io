    <p>Hi, my name is Zachary. Most people call me Zach. I made this website to showcase my wide array of hobbies and artistic endeavors. I've created this site myself using
        HTML, CSS, and SASS, and plan to update it accordingly as I continue to grow as a developer and artist. My intention is that it will provide insight into my creative process
    as well as display coninued growth and development. </p>
