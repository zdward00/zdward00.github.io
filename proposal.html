        Game Title: AstrAnimals
<br>
<br>
Tagline: Navigate through the outer expanses of space to make your home a better place.
<br>
<br>
Concept Statement: Select a pilot to cruise through space in search of resources to improve your home. Each pilot will have their own set of abilities and variations outside of the standard build. Destroy enemies and space debris as you travel, and hope the void doesn’t consume you.

Description: When playing the game, I want users to experience engaging combat, pressure, and a bit of thrill. 
The game will take place in the vast expanse of outer space in the in-game universe. While not exactly similar to our universe, this universe is similarly constantly expanding and seemingly endless. This allows for a great deal of creative liberty with the names of the planets, solar systems, moons, and other heavenly bodies that could be procedurally randomized and generated. 
The game’s characters are initially located at their home base. They set off on a journey to explore the universe and expand their knowledge so they can better their home planet. Because the universe is nearly endless, there needs to be a way to get the pilots back to their home base. With this in mind, I think it would be best for each of the pilot’s ships to have a base gas or energy expenditure that requires the ship to return back to the base at some point to refuel. As the player’s travel, they will have opportunities to gain additional fuel and even find upgrades that permanently expand the capacity of their ship.
The obstacles will also be randomized. They should track across the screen and be removed when the pilot does enough damage to the obstacle. Obstacle types will include space debris and enemies, both with a health system to track the amount of damage done. Space debris will have considerably less health than enemies and will also do equally less damage to the pilot’s ship. Enemies should be more mobile than the space debris, traveling in more diverse patterns thereby engaging the player more.
The pilots are in search of resources to better their planet, home base, and ship; they will happen across both temporary and permanent upgrades for their player, ship, and home. Upgrades will include fuel storage upgrades, weapon upgrades, health regeneration, shields, power-ups, and mobility modifiers.
The motivation for overcoming the obstacles is strengthening your character, bettering your home, and exploration.

Competition: This game feels like it’s going to be roguelike in gameplay. Roguelikes are currently one of the most rapidly expanding game types. As such, there will be plenty of competition on the market from pre-existing favorites like Hades, Enter the Gungeon, and Binding of Isaac and newer captivating titles like Ravenswatch, Slay the Spire, and Risk of Rain 2. I find that important distinguishing factors for such games are expansive skill trees/upgrades, questlines and unlockable features, and rewarding progression.  Additionally, unique art styles capture and hold player attention, which I intend to implement into the game. Another factor is engaging and well-thought out dialogue. Hades I and II are both great examples of witty and intriguing dialogue that fits the style of each character.
